# Simple application written with React Native allowing to search job opportunities

## ðŸš€ How to use

An application is not published at AppStore and Google Play. But it might be run and tested locally, following further steps:

```sh
npm run start
```

Follow instructions in terminal.
For running an application at iOS you will need an Expo Go application (available in AppStore).
